In the food delivery app project, I implemented a robust authorization mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This ensures secure user authentication and access control across the platform. JWT tokens are generated upon successful login, carrying essential user information in an encoded format. These tokens are then validated for every subsequent API request, providing a stateless, scalable, and efficient method to manage user sessions. The implementation includes token expiration handling, refreshing, and role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific features of the application.
